Description:
The REST API Client in Java is a standalone application designed to interact with RESTful web services. It enables users to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to APIs, process responses, and handle authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth, or Basic Authentication.

Features
Send HTTP Requests

Supports GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH methods.
Allows sending custom headers and query parameters.
Authentication Support

API Key Authentication
Basic Authentication
OAuth 2.0 Token-based authentication
Response Handling

Parses JSON/XML responses.
Displays status codes and response headers.
Handles error responses gracefully.
Logging & Debugging

Logs request and response details.
Provides debugging information for API calls.
Configuration Management

Supports external configuration files (e.g., config.properties or application.yml).
Allows dynamic API URL configuration.
User Interface (Optional)

CLI-based or GUI-based client using JavaFX or Swing.
Technologies Used
Java 11+ (or later)
Spring Boot (Optional) â€“ If a framework is needed for easier configuration.
HttpClient (Java Standard Library) or OkHttp/Retrofit for API calls.
Jackson/Gson for JSON processing.
SLF4J + Logback for logging.
How It Works
The user provides an API endpoint and request details.
The client sends an HTTP request using Java's HttpClient or a third-party library.
The response is parsed, and relevant data is extracted.
The response and logs are displayed to the user.
Possible Enhancements
Caching API responses.
Supporting WebSocket communication.
Creating a database integration for storing API responses.
Adding a UI dashboard for better API management.
